# DevSecOps Pipeline Templates

This directory contains reusable pipeline templates implementing DevSecOps best practices. These templates are based on the patterns and practices used in the OWASP Juice Shop project.

## Available Templates

### 1. Continuous Integration (CI)
- **File:** `ci-template.yml`
- **Description:** Template for implementing continuous integration practices
- **Features:**
  - Multi-environment testing
  - Code quality checks
  - Security scanning
  - Dependency vulnerability assessment
  - Automated testing (unit, integration, e2e)

### 2. Continuous Deployment (CD)
- **File:** `cd-template.yml`
- **Description:** Template for implementing continuous deployment practices
- **Features:**
  - Multi-stage deployments
  - Blue-green deployment strategy
  - Rollback capabilities
  - Environment-specific configurations
  - Post-deployment testing

### 3. Continuous Testing
- **File:** `continuous-testing-template.yml`
- **Description:** Template for comprehensive testing automation
- **Features:**
  - Unit testing
  - Integration testing
  - End-to-end testing
  - Performance testing
  - Security testing
  - API testing

### 4. Continuous Chaos
- **File:** `chaos-engineering-template.yml`
- **Description:** Template for chaos engineering practices
- **Features:**
  - Automated chaos experiments
  - Resilience testing
  - Failure injection
  - Monitoring and alerting
  - Recovery validation

### 5. Continuous Security
- **File:** `security-template.yml`
- **Description:** Template for security-focused pipeline
- **Features:**
  - Static Application Security Testing (SAST)
  - Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)
  - Software Composition Analysis (SCA)
  - Infrastructure as Code security scanning
  - Secret scanning
  - Compliance checks

## Usage Instructions

### GitHub Actions

1. Copy the desired template to your `.github/workflows/` directory
2. Rename the file to match your workflow name (e.g., `ci.yml`)
3. Customize the template variables and settings for your project
4. Update the trigger conditions (push, pull_request, schedule, etc.)
5. Configure any required secrets in your repository settings

### GitLab CI

1. Copy the desired template content to your `.gitlab-ci.yml` file
2. Adapt the job names and stages to match your project structure
3. Configure variables in your GitLab project settings
4. Set up any required CI/CD variables and secrets

### Other CI/CD Platforms

The templates can be adapted for other platforms like Jenkins, Azure DevOps, etc. The core concepts and practices remain the same.

## Template Structure

Each template includes:

- **Triggers:** When the pipeline should run
- **Environment Variables:** Configurable settings
- **Jobs/Stages:** Logical grouping of tasks
- **Security Checks:** Built-in security scanning
- **Notifications:** Success/failure alerts
- **Artifacts:** Output collection and storage

## Best Practices Implemented

1. **Shift Left Security:** Security checks early in the pipeline
2. **Fail Fast:** Quick feedback on failures
3. **Parallel Execution:** Optimize pipeline performance
4. **Comprehensive Testing:** Multiple testing layers
5. **Monitoring and Observability:** Built-in monitoring
6. **Configuration as Code:** Version-controlled configurations
7. **Secrets Management:** Secure handling of sensitive data
8. **Compliance:** Automated compliance checks

## Customization Guidelines

### Variables to Update

- `PROJECT_NAME`: Your project name
- `NODE_VERSION`: Your Node.js version
- `DOCKER_REGISTRY`: Your container registry
- `DEPLOYMENT_ENVIRONMENTS`: Your target environments
- `NOTIFICATION_CHANNELS`: Your notification preferences

### Security Considerations

- Replace example secrets with your actual secret names
- Review and adjust security scanning tools for your tech stack
- Configure appropriate permissions for deployment targets
- Set up proper secret rotation policies
