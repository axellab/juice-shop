# Arauco Demo Security Testing Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the automated security testing strategy for the Arauco Demo microservices in the `arauco_demo` folder.

## Security Test Coverage

### 1. Input Validation Security Tests
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Tests validate that malicious SQL queries are detected and rejected
- **XSS Attack Prevention**: Ensures script injection attempts are sanitized
- **Input Size Validation**: Prevents DoS attacks through oversized payloads
- **Data Type Validation**: Verifies proper validation of numeric, string, and object inputs

### 2. Authentication and Authorization Tests
- **Unauthorized Access Prevention**: Ensures protected endpoints require authentication
- **Token Validation**: Tests JWT token validation and rejection of invalid tokens
- **Privilege Escalation Prevention**: Prevents users from gaining unauthorized privileges
- **Session Security**: Validates proper session management

### 3. Data Protection Tests
- **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Ensures payment card data is not exposed in responses
- **Data Masking**: Verifies credit card numbers are properly masked in UI
- **Logging Security**: Prevents sensitive information from being logged
- **Tokenization Security**: Tests secure token generation for payment methods

### 4. Business Logic Security Tests
- **Amount Validation**: Prevents negative or invalid payment amounts
- **Transaction Limits**: Enforces maximum transaction amounts
- **Order Integrity**: Validates order data cannot be tampered with
- **Refund Validation**: Ensures refund amounts and reasons are properly validated

### 5. API Security Tests
- **Error Handling**: Ensures errors don't expose sensitive system information
- **Rate Limiting**: Tests protection against rapid request abuse
- **CORS Configuration**: Validates proper cross-origin request handling
- **Content Type Validation**: Ensures proper handling of different content types

### 6. Integration Security Tests
- **Service Communication**: Tests secure communication between microservices
- **Error Propagation**: Ensures errors are handled securely across service boundaries
- **Context Preservation**: Validates security context is maintained during operations
- **Failover Security**: Tests secure behavior when services are unavailable

## Test Files Structure

## Running Security Tests

### API Security Tests
```bash
npm run test:api
```

### Server Security Tests
```bash
npm run test:server
```

### End-to-End Security Tests
```bash
npm run cypress:run
```

### All Security Tests
```bash
npm test
```

## Security Test Categories

### High Priority Security Tests
1. **Input Validation**: Prevents injection attacks (SQL, XSS, Script)
2. **Authentication**: Ensures proper access controls
3. **Data Protection**: Protects sensitive payment information
4. **Business Logic**: Prevents financial manipulation

### Medium Priority Security Tests
1. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and DoS attacks
2. **Error Handling**: Prevents information disclosure
3. **Session Management**: Maintains secure user context
4. **API Security**: Proper endpoint protection

### Monitoring and Maintenance
1. **Automated Execution**: Tests run in CI/CD pipeline
2. **Security Regression**: Prevents introduction of new vulnerabilities
3. **Compliance Validation**: Ensures adherence to security standards
4. **Performance Impact**: Monitors security controls don't impact performance

## Integration with CI/CD Pipeline

The security tests are designed to be integrated into continuous testing pipelines:

1. **Pre-commit Hooks**: Run critical security tests before code commits
2. **Pull Request Validation**: Execute full security test suite on PRs
3. **Deployment Gates**: Block deployments if security tests fail
4. **Scheduled Security Scans**: Regular execution of comprehensive security tests

## Security Test Maintenance

### Regular Updates Required
- Update injection attack patterns as new threats emerge
- Refresh authentication test scenarios
- Update business logic validation rules
- Review and update security thresholds

### Compliance Considerations
- PCI DSS compliance for payment processing
- GDPR compliance for data protection
- Industry-specific security requirements
- Organizational security policies

## Security Tools Integration

The tests are designed to complement other security tools:

1. **Static Analysis**: SAST tools for code vulnerability scanning
2. **Dynamic Analysis**: DAST tools for runtime vulnerability testing
3. **Dependency Scanning**: Checks for vulnerable dependencies
4. **Container Security**: Security scanning of containerized services

## Metrics and Reporting

Security test metrics to track:

1. **Test Coverage**: Percentage of security requirements covered
2. **Vulnerability Detection**: Number of security issues found and fixed
3. **False Positive Rate**: Accuracy of security test detection
4. **Test Execution Time**: Performance impact of security testing

## Emergency Response

In case security tests detect vulnerabilities:

1. **Immediate Response**: Stop deployments if critical issues found
2. **Risk Assessment**: Evaluate severity and impact of detected issues
3. **Remediation**: Apply fixes and re-run security tests
4. **Post-Incident Review**: Update tests to prevent similar issues

## Training and Documentation

Team members should be familiar with:

1. **Security Testing Principles**: Understanding of common vulnerabilities
2. **Test Framework Usage**: How to run and interpret security tests
3. **Security Best Practices**: Secure coding practices for microservices
4. **Incident Response**: How to respond to security test failures
